						<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>
								My past superiors have called me "a diamond in the rough" and "One of our greatest assets."  
								Having been known to "really dig in and learn quick" has made me the go to guy.
								Being a thinker and a problem solver has fueled my love for a good challenge.  
								While my curiosity has made me a quick learner and a self starter.
								When learning new skills just being a craftsman isn't enough for me.
								Trying to make things better and more efficient is fun to me. 									
								Extraordinary is my ordinary and doing the things others only dream of is my normal.

											I worked with a team of other engineers to improve on the in house ETL software and public facing data access portal.

											Created a JavaScript library of widgets to easily allow new reports to be created and customized for customers.
											The library allowed reports to be more interactive and responsive, faster to create, and caused them to act more like single page applications than static reports.
											jQuery is so much easier to process xml with than xslt/xPath.

											such as PDF's, Spreadsheets, and plain text reports.  If it was an ugly mess it was up to me to turn it into a clean csv no matter what the original file format.
											If cleaning up the ugliest data imaginable wasn't enough.  I also made every effort to automate the entire process I used so it could be done over and over again without user intervention.
											The Linux command line is something I never thought I would know so much about. It's truely amazing what can be accomplished with it.

											What we accomplished in a day was nothing short of a logistical miracle.  Something you would have to see to believe.

									This is where I cut my teeth on SEO.  Through a lot of studying, research and testing I mastered SEO.  
									The site ranked above all it's competitors, and even the OEM sites for the products the company sold and repaired.  
									SEO became a game for me while I was there just being on the top wasn't	enough for me.  
									I wanted the site to be the only one found and I succeeded.  
									Links to the companies site filled the first two SERP's for most keywords.
